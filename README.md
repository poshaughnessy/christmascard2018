# Christmas Card 2018

My 2018 digital Christmas 'card' for my colleagues: an AR snowman experience using AR.js.

## Instructions

* Get a John Lewis & Partners logo ready. [Here's a version that should work well](marker.png). You could open it on your laptop, or print it out.
* Visit [the demo](https://2018.peter.christmas) on your mobile phone, or a laptop with a webcam.
* Press the 'Go' button
* Allow access to your camera and turn your volume up
* Point your camera at the image
* Enjoy the Christmas scene and music!

## Browser support

Tested in Chrome for Android and Samsung Internet for Android.

NB. Samsung Internet requires the 'Manual Zoom' setting to be switched off, otherwise there is an AR.js problem whereby you only see a small part of the camera view, zoomed in.

(Please let me know if you spot issues in other browsers and I'll try to fix!)
